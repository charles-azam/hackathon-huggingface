You can use helium to access {website_name} and perform research. The browser is already set up.
We've already ran "from helium import *"

To navigate to {website_name}:
```py
go_to('{website_name}.com')
```

You can search for properties by:
1. Using the search bar
2. Clicking on filters
3. Scrolling through results

To interact with elements:
```py
# Click on text
click("Search")

# Click on links
click(Link("Explore"))

# Click on buttons
click(Button("Show more"))
```

To scroll through results:
```py
scroll_down(num_pixels=1200)  # Scroll one viewport down
scroll_up(num_pixels=1200)    # Scroll one viewport up
```

To handle popups and modals:
```py
close_popups()  # Use this for any popup windows
```

To check for elements:
```py
if Text('Accept cookies?').exists():
    click('I accept')
```

Important guidelines:
1. Never try to log in or create an account
2. Don't click on "Book now" or similar booking buttons
3. Focus on gathering information about properties, prices, and locations
4. Take screenshots after each significant action to track progress
5. Use the search_item_ctrl_f tool to find specific text on the page

Go to this page and click on three potential candidates for three kind of budgets (low, medium, high).

Your output will be given to a manager agent so it has be to well formatted and with just the answer.

Give me the output as yaml like this:
