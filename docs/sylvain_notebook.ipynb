    "\n",
    "Key helium commands:\n",
    "- go_to('url'): Navigate to a URL\n",
    "- click(\"text\"): Click on text or button\n",
    "- click(Link(\"text\")): Click on a link\n",
    "- scroll_down(num_pixels=800): Scroll down\n",
    "- scroll_up(num_pixels=800): Scroll up\n",
    "- wait_until(lambda: Text('text').exists()): Wait for element\n",
    "\n",
    "For Google Flights specifically:\n",
    "1. First go to the provided Google Flights URL\n",
    "2. Wait for the page to load completely (use wait_for_page_load(5))\n",
    "3. Close any popups or cookie banners with close_popups()\n",
    "4. Look for flight results and extract information\n",
    "5. Try to click on flight options to get booking links\n",
    "6. Be patient - Google Flights loads dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "Always take screenshots after each action to see the current state.\n",
    "When you find booking buttons or \"Select\" buttons, click them to get airline booking links.\n",

    "Important: Google Flights often has multiple steps:\n",
    "1. Search results page\n",
    "2. Flight details page after clicking a flight\n",
    "3. Booking page or redirect to airline website\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to collect 5 flight booking links with their details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your tools:\n",
    "- extract_flight_info(): To get flight information from the current page\n",
    "- click_flight_option(number): To click on a specific flight\n",
    "- wait_for_page_load(seconds): To wait for page loading\n",
